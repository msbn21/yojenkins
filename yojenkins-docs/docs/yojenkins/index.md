`yojenkins` is a cross-platform command line interface (CLI) tool to monitor,
manage, and have fun with a Jenkins server. It makes it possible to interact
with a Jenkins server without using the browser based Jenkins UI.

This tool is able to be integrated into a script as middleware in
order to automate Jenkins related tasks or enable Jenkins configuration
as code.

**`yojenkins` will liberate you and your browser from the Jenkins Web UI**


With `yojenkins` you can manage:

- **Authentication**: *Authentication structure similar to AWS CLI*
- **Server**: *Create, shutdown, view queue, and more*
- **User accounts**: *Create, delete, add/remove permission, and more*
- **Nodes/agents:** *Create, delete, shut down server, and more*
- **Credentials**: *Create, update, delete, list, and more*
- **Folders:** *Create items, delete items, disable, enable, and more*
- **Jobs:** *Create, delete, diff, trigger, monitor, search, and more*
- **Builds:** *Monitor, diff, abort, tail logs, follow logs, and more*
- **Stages:** *Get info, get logs, view steps, view status*
- **Steps:** *Get info*
