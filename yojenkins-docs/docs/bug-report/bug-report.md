# Bug Report

As with any other software, issues do come up during various usage scenarios
that may not be accounted for during development and testing.
**Help from real users is enormously helpful.**

Please report bugs and odd behaviors with:

- Online at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ismet55555/yojenkins/issues/new?assignees=ismet55555&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+)
- `yojenkins tools bug-report`

## Include `--debug` Output

If possible, when reporting a bug, please include the command that caused
the issue in debug mode. You can do this by running the command
with the `--debug` option. This will allow for clearer communication of what was going on
and a somewhat easier time resolving the issue.

For example, below is the output of a failed `yojenkins` command in debug mode.

**Command**

```
yojenkins server info --debug
```

**Terminal Output**
